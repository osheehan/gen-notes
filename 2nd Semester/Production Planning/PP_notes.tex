        \subsection{Phases 2}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Time
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item What is the difference between ``labor hours'' and ``linear time''?
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Linear time is clock time
                        \item Labor hours are ``effort'' --- home many hours of work does it take to get something completed
                        \item the amount of linear time for a project may be shortened or lengthened by adding or removing effort:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item 2 people x 4 hours = 8 labor hours \& 4 hours linear time
                            \item 4 people x 2 hours = 8 labor hours \& 2 hours linear time
                        \end{itemize}
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
                \item Budgeting
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item When budgeting, you want to break even, you don't want to run short on money, or leave money unused
                    \item if you are 5--10\% over, you can make up that money up from somewhere that doesn't really matter, generally from changing the way we fabricate something
                    \item 10--50\% over, can be made up from slightly changing the design
                    \item Generally the biggest, most expensive things get cut first
                    \item More than 50\% over means something is going to have to substantially change
                    \item more often than not, can warrant a complete redesign
                    \item x
