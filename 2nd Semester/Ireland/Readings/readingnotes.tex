            \begin{itemize}
                \item in 1800 there was roughly 1,850 priests, 26 bishops, 122 nuns, and a faithful population of 3,900,000
                \item ``What emerges, then, even from this cursory analysis, is simply
                that before the famine any effective service on the part of the clergy was
                severely limited by the sheer weight of lay numbers, and that up to 1840,
                at least, the situation had been getting progressively worse'' (p. 627).
